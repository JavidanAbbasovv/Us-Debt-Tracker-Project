This repository contains my analysis of U.S. debt trends using Excel. The project focuses on tracking debt over time while answering three specific questions related to debt patterns, increases, and historical trends.

The analysis was performed using Excel features, including:

Pivot Tables – to summarize and analyze large datasets efficiently.

Charts – to visualize debt trends and patterns clearly.

Functions and Calculations – to perform numerical analysis, compute growth rates, and extract insights.

The goal of this project is to understand how U.S. debt changes over time, identify patterns, and provide a clear visual and numerical interpretation of the data.
